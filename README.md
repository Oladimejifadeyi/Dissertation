## Loan Default prediction Model For Digital Lenders, Using Nigeria as a Case Study
The aim of this study is to investigate how machine learning techniques can be utilised in loan default prediction by digital lenders in Nigeria. 
Since we are dealing with supervised binary classification problems. The goal is to maximize predictability, gain a deeper understanding of customer's loan history, and train the best machine learning models to minimize the risk of future loan defaults.To achieve this, seven models were built and their performance was evaluated. The seven machine learning algorithms are as follows:

1. Logistic Regression

2. K Nearest Neighbor

3. Decision Tree Model

4. Random Forest

5. Naive Bayes 

6. Support Vector Machine

7. Neural Network

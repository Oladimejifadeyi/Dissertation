## Loan Default prediction Model For Digital Lenders, Using Nigeria as a Case Study
The aim of this study is to investigate how machine learning techniques can be utilised in loan default prediction by digital lenders in Nigeria. To achieve this, the following objectives are identified:
To review the existing literature on loan default prediction using machine learning techniques. 
To undertake exploratory data analysis of a dataset (Zindi dataset) containing socio-demographic data such as age, customer's employment status, and customer level of education of a digital lending operator in Nigeria.  
To train the Zindi dataset to build and test machine learning models for loan default prediction. The machine learning algorithms applied are: 
Logistic Regression (LR)
K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
Decision Tree Model (DCT)
Random Forest (RF)
Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network (NN)

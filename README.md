## Loan Default prediction Model For Digital Lenders, Using Nigeria as a Case Study
The aim of this study is to investigate how machine learning techniques can be utilised in loan default prediction by digital lenders in Nigeria. To achieve this, seven models were built and their performance was evaluated. The seven machine learning algorithms are as follows:

1. Logistic Regression

2. K Nearest Neighbor

3. Decision Tree Model

4. Random Forest

5. Naive Bayes 

6. Support Vector Machine

7. Neural Network
